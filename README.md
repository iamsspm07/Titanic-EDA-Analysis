Titanic Data Analysis

Project Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic dataset, using various techniques and methods to explore and visualize the data. The project focuses on understanding the survival rate, the factors influencing survival, and visualizing various insights from the dataset.

Key Features:
Data exploration and cleaning
Outlier detection and handling
Age group categorization
Visualizations such as histograms, pie charts, scatter plots, etc.
Basic machine learning for predictions (optional, based on the dataset)

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Seaborn. It includes information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including features like:

Survived: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0)
Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
Fare: The fare the passenger paid for the ticket
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard

Installation

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-data-analysis.git
Install required dependencies:

The project depends on the following libraries:
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn (if you're using machine learning models)
You can install the dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook: After installing the required libraries, you can run the Jupyter notebook for analysis:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the Titanic_Analysis.ipynb notebook in your browser and start working with the data.

Usage

1 Load the dataset using Seaborn or any other method.
2 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualizations, and outlier detection.
3 Optionally, build predictive models (like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) based on the dataset to predict survival chances.

Visualizations:

This project includes various visualizations such as:

1 Pie charts to represent the distribution of categories like sex, survival, etc.
2 Bar graphs to show ag1e group distributions and more.
3 Scatter plots to analyze relationships between features.
